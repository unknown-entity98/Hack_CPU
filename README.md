This is my attempt to build a hack CPU (16-bit) in JAVA. I built this by myself ~ Gin
##Contents of the hack CPU
Essentially, the hack CPU is just a demo CPU. It is supposed to have a ROM, ALU and RAM. I was able to replicate this structure in hdl (Nand2Tetris). But in JAVA, we don't have the 'clock' element that occurs in sequential ciruits, and we do not have a ROM or RAM. 
Besides, I'll have to look into it more and am currently working on other things ðŸ˜‰
